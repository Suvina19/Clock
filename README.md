Time Flies

People often say, "Time flies," and it does. I still can't believe it's been over a month since I moved to another country. So, this is my way to symbolically explore time and how it appears to pass quickly in our lives. The name "Time Flies" suggests that time seems to rush, and this clock visually represents this idea by having elements constantly in motion every second.
