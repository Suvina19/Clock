Time Flies

The project is called time flies because we often hear people say "time flies". It is my way to symbolically explore the concept of time and how it appears to pass quickly in our lives. The name "Time Flies" suggests that time seems to move rapidly, and this clock visually represents this idea by having elements constantly in motion every second.
