# Clock
Time Flies

People often say, "Time flies," and it does. I still can't believe it's been over a month since I moved to another country. So, this is my way to symbolically explore time and how it appears to pass quickly in our lives. The name "Time Flies" suggests that time seems to rush, and this clock visually represents this idea by having elements constantly in motion every second.

Grandfather's clock

I had this idea to recreate the classic charm of a Grandfather clock, and I wanted to make a cartoonish clock like the enchanted clock with eyes from 'Beauty and the Beast,' but it turned out to be way more complicated than I thought.

I started calculating the pendulum's swing using radians and watched a lot of tutorials to understand the calculations. It seemed like a good plan until I tried to add in the clock's hands â€“ hours, seconds, and minutes. That's when it all went crazy, which made me use ChatGPT. I got the code right for the clock hands in radians, which I have attached here, too, but I wanted a project that wasn't as tangled up in math, and that's how 'Time Flies' came to be.
